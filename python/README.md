# **AI module**

The AI module runs models trained and packed with the [Stable Baselines](https://stable-baselines.readthedocs.io/en/master/) Reinforcement Learning library. However, we currently use our [altered version](https://github.com/BrunoBSM/stable-baselines/tree/Beta-Dist) of such library that allows the use of Beta Distributions. It is outdated and we are working on updating everything as soon as possible.

To install it, please download the `Beta-Dist` branch in [this repository](https://github.com/BrunoBSM/stable-baselines/tree/Beta-Dist) and follow the steps to install the dependencies first, and finally the whole library with `pip install -e .`
